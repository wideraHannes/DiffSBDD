# 📅 Training Diary - September 23, 2025

## 🎯 Today's Mission

Successfully set up and run DiffSBDD training pipeline with ESM-C thesis preparation.

---

## ✅ **Major Accomplishments**

### 🛠️ **1. Environment & Pipeline Setup**

- **Environment Management**: Successfully migrated to `uv` for faster dependency management
  - `uv sync` working flawlessly
  - All dependencies properly resolved
  - Much faster than traditional pip/conda approach

### 🔧 **2. Critical Bug Fixes & Compatibility Issues**

#### **PyTorch Lightning 2.x Compatibility** 🎯

**Problem**: The codebase was written for PyTorch Lightning 1.x, but current environment uses 2.x
**Solutions Implemented**:

```python
# Fixed validation method signature
# OLD: validation_epoch_end(self, validation_step_outputs)
# NEW: on_validation_epoch_end(self)

# Fixed gradient clipping method signature
# OLD: configure_gradient_clipping(self, optimizer, optimizer_idx, ...)
# NEW: configure_gradient_clipping(self, optimizer, ...)
```

#### **Dataset Configuration Mismatch** 🎯

**Problem**: Tensor dimension mismatch (14 vs 13 features)
**Root Cause**: Original config used `crossdock` (10 atom types) but processed data has 11 features
**Solution**: Changed to `dataset: "crossdock_full"` which includes 'others' category

#### **CPU Training Setup** 🎯

**Problem**: Code hardcoded for GPU training
**Solution**: Implemented flexible accelerator configuration in `train.py`:

```python
if args.gpus > 0:
    accelerator = "gpu"
    devices = args.gpus
    strategy = "ddp" if args.gpus > 1 else "auto"
else:
    accelerator = "cpu"
    devices = "auto"
    strategy = "auto"
```

#### **Data Key Mismatch** 🎯

**Problem**: Code expected 'receptors' key but data only had 'names'
**Solution**: Added fallback logic in lightning_modules.py:

```python
receptor_names = batch.get("receptors", batch.get("names", []))
```

### 🚀 **3. Successful Training Run**

- **Model**: ConditionalDDPM with 4.8M parameters (~19.3MB)
- **Configuration**: CPU-only training with optimized settings
- **Performance**: ~2.2 iterations/second on CPU
- **Epochs**: Successfully completed training runs
- **Checkpoints**: Automatic saving working perfectly

### 📋 **4. Configuration Optimization**

Created `crossdock_fullatom_cond_playground.yml` with:

- CPU-optimized settings (`device: "cpu"`, `gpus: 0`)
- Reduced batch size for memory efficiency (`batch_size: 1`)
- Shortened epochs for quick testing (`n_epochs: 10`)
- Disabled WandB for local development (`mode: "disabled"`)
- Frequent evaluation for development feedback

### 📊 **5. Model Validation**

- **Checkpoint Generation**: Multiple checkpoints created successfully
  - `logs/SE3-cond-full-playground/checkpoints/last.ckpt`
  - `logs/SE3-cond-full-playground/checkpoints/best-model-epoch=XX.ckpt`
- **Training Progress**: Model successfully learned and improved over epochs
- **No Critical Errors**: All major compatibility issues resolved

---

## 🧠 **Technical Insights Gained**

### **Dataset Understanding**

- CrossDock processed data structure: 11 atom features (not 10)
- Data keys: `names`, `lig_coords`, `lig_one_hot`, `pocket_coords`, etc.
- Feature dimensions: ligand `[n_atoms, 11]`, pocket `[n_residues, 11]`

### **Model Architecture**

- ConditionalDDPM: Equivariant graph neural network with diffusion
- EGNN layers: 6 layers, 256 hidden features, attention mechanism
- Diffusion: 500 steps, polynomial_2 noise schedule

### **Training Dynamics**

- CPU training feasible but ~10x slower than GPU
- Memory requirements: ~1-2GB RAM for CPU training
- Gradient clipping essential for stable training
- Batch size 1 works for development/debugging
