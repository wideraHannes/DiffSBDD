# Day 4: Baseline Model Validation

**Date**: 2024-12-06  
**Status**: 🔄 In Progress  
**Focus**: Validate original DiffSBDD trains correctly before ESM-C modifications

---

## Summary

Day 3 overfit test showed concerning behavior (loss stuck at 0.5, 0% connectivity). Before debugging further, we need to verify the **original model works** on realistic data.

---

## Tasks

### 1. Baseline Training Validation

- [ ] Run training on full dataset for 50 epochs
- [ ] Observe loss curves (should decrease steadily)
- [ ] Check if connectivity > 0% appears
- [ ] Document training dynamics

### 2. Analysis

- [ ] Compare training dynamics to Day 3 overfit
- [ ] Identify if issue is model or data size
- [ ] Decide next steps based on results

---

## Commands

```bash
# Main training run
uv run python train.py --config thesis_work/experiments/day4_baseline_validation/configs/baseline_validation.yml

# Alternative: Test pretrained checkpoint directly
uv run python test.py --checkpoint checkpoints/crossdocked_fullatom_cond.ckpt \
    --test_dir data/processed_crossdock_noH_full_temp
```

## Key Insight from Day 3

The overfit test was **too hard**:

- 500 diffusion steps = 500 denoising transitions to learn
- 5 samples = not enough variety
- Loss of 0.5 = ~50% MSE error predicting noise

**Expected**: On full dataset, loss should decrease from ~2.0 → ~0.5 over many epochs.

## Results

### Training Metrics (Update as training progresses)

| Epoch | Train Loss | Val Loss | Connectivity | Notes |
| ----- | ---------- | -------- | ------------ | ----- |
| 1     |            |          |              |       |
| 10    |            |          |              |       |
| 25    |            |          |              |       |
| 50    |            |          |              |       |

### Observations

- TBD after training run

## Conclusions

- TBD

## Next Steps

- [ ] If baseline works → Return to overfit with adjusted expectations
- [ ] If baseline fails → Debug model/data pipeline
