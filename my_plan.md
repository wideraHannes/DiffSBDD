# DiffSBDD Master's Thesis Plan

## 🎯 Project Overview

Structure-based drug design using diffusion models to generate drug-like molecules for protein pockets.

## 📁 Key Directories

├── data/processed_crossdock_noH_full_temp/       # Processed dataset
├── results/                                      # Generated molecules
└── analyze_results.py                           # Quality evaluation
```

## 🚀 Quick Start Commands

### Data Processing

_This step converts raw protein-ligand data into a format the AI model can understand. Think of it like preparing ingredients before cooking - we clean the data, extract important features, and organize everything properly._

```bash
# Process CrossDock dataset (debug: 100 train, 10 test)
python process_crossdock.py --basedir data --no_H
```

### Generate Molecules

_This is where the magic happens! The AI model looks at protein pockets and creates new drug-like molecules that could potentially bind to them. It's like having a chemist design new drugs, but much faster._

```bash
# Debug mode (fast)
uv run test.py checkpoints/crossdocked_fullatom_cond.ckpt \
    --test_dir data/processed_crossdock_noH_full_temp/test/ \
    --outdir results/debug_eval \
    --sanitize --batch_size 1 --n_samples 1 --timesteps 10

# Production mode
uv run test.py checkpoints/crossdocked_fullatom_cond.ckpt \
    --test_dir data/processed_crossdock_noH_full_temp/test/ \
    --outdir results/full_eval \
    --sanitize --batch_size 50 --n_samples 100
```

### Evaluate Quality

_After generating molecules, we need to check if they're actually good! This analyzes whether the molecules are chemically valid, drug-like, and have the right properties to be potential medicines._

```bash
# Analyze generated molecules
uv run analyze_results.py results/debug_eval
```

## 🎓 Thesis Development Plan

### Phase 1: Baseline Understanding ✅

_First, you need to understand how the existing system works. Like learning to drive with an instructor before going solo - you master the basics before making improvements._

- [x] Setup DiffSBDD environment
- [x] Process CrossDock dataset
- [x] Run pre-trained model evaluation
- [x] Achieve 100% validity, good drug-likeness

### Phase 2: Model Training

_Now you'll train your own AI model from scratch. This is like teaching a student chemistry - you feed it lots of examples until it learns the patterns of good drug design._

```bash
# Train custom model
python train.py --config configs/my_model.yml
```

### Phase 3: Research Contributions

_This is where you make your unique contribution to science! You'll improve the existing methods or create entirely new approaches. Think of it as inventing a better recipe._

1. **Novel Architecture**: Modify EGNN layers
2. **Better Conditioning**: Enhanced pocket features
3. **Evaluation Metrics**: New molecular properties
4. **Target Applications**: Specific protein families

### Phase 4: Experiments & Evaluation

_The final step is proving your improvements actually work better than existing methods. Like a taste test - you compare your new recipe against the old ones to show it's superior._

```python
experiments = {
    'baseline': 'crossdocked_fullatom_cond.ckpt',
    'my_model_v1': 'configs/thesis_v1.yml',
    'my_model_v2': 'configs/thesis_v2.yml'
}
```

## 📊 Quality Benchmarks

_These numbers tell you if your AI is doing a good job. Think of them like grades on a report card - they measure different aspects of how well the model creates drug-like molecules._

### Current Results (Debug Eval)

- **Validity**: 100% (10/10 molecules) - _All molecules are chemically possible_
- **Drug-likeness (QED)**: 0.532 ± 0.126 - _Molecules look like real drugs_
- **Lipinski Compliance**: 100% - _Follow pharmaceutical "rules of thumb"_
- **Molecular Weight**: 222.5 ± 105.5 Da - _Right size for drug molecules_

### Target Improvements

_Goals for your thesis - what you want to make better than the current system._

- [ ] Increase molecular diversity - _Create more varied molecule types_
- [ ] Improve binding affinity prediction - _Better at predicting which molecules stick to proteins_
- [ ] Faster generation speed - _Make the AI work quicker_
- [ ] Novel chemical scaffolds - _Discover completely new types of drug structures_

## 🔧 Development Setup

_These are like different "difficulty settings" for your AI. Start with easy/fast settings for testing, then use harder/slower settings for final results._

### Debug Parameters

```bash
--batch_size 1 --n_samples 1 --timesteps 10    # Ultra-fast (for testing)
--batch_size 10 --n_samples 10 --timesteps 50  # Medium (for development)
--batch_size 50 --n_samples 100                # Production (for final results)
```

### Training Config Template

_This file tells the AI how to learn. Like setting study hours, difficulty level, and learning pace for a student._

```yaml
model:
  n_layers: 9 # How deep/complex the AI brain is
  lig_max_radius: 2 # How far molecules can "see" their neighbors
  pocket_max_radius: 6 # How far proteins can "see" their neighbors

training:
  n_epochs: 3000 # How many times to study the entire dataset
  batch_size: 32 # How many examples to study at once
  lr: 1e-4 # How fast the AI learns (learning rate)
```
